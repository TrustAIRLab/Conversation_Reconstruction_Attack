        "user_query": "Context:\nIn 1838 with the amount of smuggled opium entering China approaching 1,400 tons a year, the Chinese imposed a death penalty for opium smuggling and sent a Special Imperial Commissioner, Lin Zexu, to curb smuggling. This resulted in the First Opium War (1839\u201342). After the war Hong Kong island was ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Nanking and the Chinese market opened to the opium traders of Britain and other nations. The Jardines and Apcar and Company dominated the trade, although P&O also tried to take a share. A Second Opium War fought by Britain and France against China lasted from 1856 until 1860 and led to the Treaty of Tientsin, which legalised the importation of opium. Legalisation stimulated domestic Chinese opium production and increased the importation of opium from Turkey and Persia. This increased competition for the Chinese market led to India reducing its opium output and diversifying its exports.\nQuestion:\nin 1838 what was the sentence for smuggling opium in to China?",
        "reply_to_user": "In 1838, the sentence for smuggling opium into China was the death penalty."

        "user_query": "Context:\nIn England, one of the few licensed venues The Eclipse attracted people from up and down the country as it was open until the early hours. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 was a government attempt to ban large rave dance events featuring music with \"repetitive beats\". There were a number of abortive \"Kill the Bill\" demonstrations. The Spiral Tribe at Castle Morten was probably the nail in the coffin for illegal raves, and forced through the bill, which became law, in November 1994. The music continued to grow and change, as typified by Leftfield with \"Release the Pressure\", which introduced dub and reggae into the house sound, although Leftfield had prior releases, such as \"Not Forgotten\" released in 1990 on Sheffield's Outer Rhythm records.\nQuestion:\nwho recorded the hit single \"release the pressure\"?",

        "user_query": "Context:\nUnder modern constitutional conventions, the sovereign acts on the advice of his or her ministers. Since these ministers most often maintain the support of parliament and are the ones who obtain the passage of bills, it is highly improbable that they would advise the sovereign to withhold assent. An exception is sometimes stated to be if bills are not passed in good faith, though it is difficult to make an interpretation on what this circumstance might constitute. Hence, in modern practice, royal assent is always granted; a refusal to do so would be appropriate only in an emergency requiring the use of the monarch's reserve powers.\nQuestion:\nIn the event that the monarch refuses to give royal assent, what can the monarch make use of?",
        "reply_to_user": "According to the context, in the event that the monarch refuses to give royal assent, the monarch can make use of their \"reserve powers\" in an emergency."

        "user_query": "Context:\nThe attacks were focused against western ports in March. These attacks produced some breaks in morale, with civil leaders fleeing the cities before the offensive reached its height. But the Luftwaffe's effort eased in the last 10 attacks as seven Kampfgruppen moved to Austria in preparation for the Balkans Campaign in Yugoslavia and Greece. The shortage of bombers caused the OKL to improvise. Some 50 Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive-bombers and Jabos (fighter-bombers) were used, officially classed as Leichte Kampfflugzeuge (\"light bombers\") and sometimes called Leichte Kesselringe (\"Light Kesselrings\"). The defences failed to prevent widespread damage but on some occasions did prevent German bombers concentrating on their targets. On occasion, only one-third of German bombs hit their targets.\nQuestion:\nWhy was the OKL forced to improvise?",
